This is a software engineering project in my school learning about how to use JWT
if you want to run it, type the following commands:

**yarn add**

**yarn server**

Test it in request.http file (or postman ;) )

if you wanna see database, go to .env file and change MONGODB_URL to be your mongodb url

there are nothing in http://localhost:5000, don't try to open it
